/*
It's possible to do this in one line if you would like!
Some similar examples from other languages:
- In C(++) this would be: `a > b ? a : b`
- In Python this would be:  `a if a > b else b`
Remember in Rust that:
- the `if` condition does not need to be surrounded by parentheses
- `if`/`else` conditionals are expressions
- Each condition is followed by a `{}` block.
