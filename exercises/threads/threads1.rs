// Make this compile! Execute `rustlings hint threads1` for hints :)
// The idea is the thread spawned on line 22 is completing jobs while the main thread is
// monitoring progress until 10 jobs are completed. Because of the difference between the
// spawned threads' sleep time, and the waiting threads sleep time, when you see 6 lines
// of "waiting..." and the program ends without timing out when running,
// you've got it :)

/*
`Arc` is an Atomic Reference Counted pointer that allows safe, shared access
to **immutable** data. But we want to *change* the number of `jobs_completed`
so we'll need to also use another type that will only allow one thread to
mutate the data at a time. Take a look at this section of the book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-03-shared-state.html#atomic-reference-counting-with-arct
and keep reading if you'd like more hints :)


Do you now have an `Arc` `Mutex` `JobStatus` at the beginning of main? Like:
`let status = Arc::new(Mutex::new(JobStatus { jobs_completed: 0 }));`
Similar to the code in the example in the book that happens after the text
that says "We can use Arc<T> to fix this.". If not, give that a try! If you
do and would like more hints, keep reading!!


Make sure neither of your threads are holding onto the lock of the mutex
while they are sleeping, since this will prevent the other thread from
being allowed to get the lock. Locks are automatically released when
they go out of scope.

Ok, so, real talk, this was actually tricky for *me* to do too. And
I could see a lot of different problems you might run into, so at this
point I'm not sure which one you've hit :)

Please open an issue if you're still running into a problem that
these hints are not helping you with, or if you've looked at the sample
answers and don't understand why they work and yours doesn't.

If you've learned from the sample solutions, I encourage you to come
back to this exercise and try it again in a few days to reinforce
what you've learned :)
