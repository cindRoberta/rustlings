/*
The compiler message is saying that Rust cannot infer the type that the
variable binding `x` has with what is given here.
What happens if you annotate line 7 with a type annotation?
What if you give x a value?
What if you do both?
What type should x be, anyway?
What if x is the same type as 10? What if it's a different type?
